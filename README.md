# HW-4

## Description
In this homework assignment, I was able to use all the information I learned about HTML, CSS, and Javascript in order to produce a coding quiz for users to take. When a user logs onto my quiz, the user will be able to start the quiz, which will present them with 5 different questions. For every question the user gets wrong, 5 seconds will be deducted from their remaining time. Once all of the questions are answered, the user will be able to input their name or initials and save it onto the local storage. This will also make it appear in the "Highscores" page for the user to look back on. If the user decides to go back and retake the quiz, their new score will appear under their previous score. If the user wishes to clear all scores, the scores will disappear from the site and the local storage.

### Functions
- Each question, choices, and answers are written to go in a desired function
- When user clicks the "Start Game" button, the questions appear and the timer starts
